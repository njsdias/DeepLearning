    "Like the skip-gram model, the CBOW model is a classifier that takes the **context words as input**\n",
    "and predicts the target word. The **input to the model is the word IDs** for the context words. These word IDs are fed into a common **embedding layer** that is initialized with **small random weights**. Each word ID is transformed\n",
    "into a vector of size (*embed_size*) by the embedding layer. Thus, **each row of the input context** is\n",
    "transformed into a **matrix of size (2*window_size, embed_size)** by this layer. This is then fed into a lambda\n",
    "layer, which computes an average of all the embeddings. This **average is then fed to a dense layer**,\n",
    "which creates a dense vector of size (vocab_size) for each row. The **activation function** on the dense\n",
    "layer is a **softmax**, which reports the maximum value on the **output vector as a probability**. The ID\n",
    "with the **maximum probability** corresponds to the **target word**.\n",

    "The deliverable for the CBOW model is the weights from the embedding layer shown in gray in the\n",
