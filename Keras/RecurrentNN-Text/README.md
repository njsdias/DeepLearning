### 1. Recurrent Neural Network â€” RNN

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) is a class of neural networks that exploit the sequential nature of their input. 
Such inputs could be:
- text, 
- speech, 
- time series, 
- and anything else where the occurrence of an element in the sequence is dependent on the elements that
appeared before it. 

For example, the next word in the sentence the dog... is more likely to be barks
than car, therefore, given such a sequence, an RNN is more likely to predict barks than car.
