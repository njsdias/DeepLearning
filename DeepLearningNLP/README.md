Natural language processing (NPL) is an extremely difficult task in
computer science. Languages present a wide variety of problems that
vary from language to language. Structuring or extracting meaningful
information from free text represents a great solution, if done in the
right manner. Previously, computer scientists broke a language into its
grammatical forms, such as parts of speech, phrases, etc., using complex
algorithms. Today, deep learning is a key to performing the same exercises.
