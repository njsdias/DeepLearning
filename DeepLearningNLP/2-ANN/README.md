### 1. Deep Learning for NLP

Traditional neural networks lack the ability to capture knowledge from
previous events and pass it on to future events and related predictions. In
this chapter, we will introduce a family of neural networks that can help us
in persisting information over an extensive period.

In deep learning, all problems are generally classified into two types:
• Fixed topological structure: For images having static
data, with use cases such as image classification
• Sequential data: For text/audio with dynamic data, in
tasks related to text generation and voice recognition
