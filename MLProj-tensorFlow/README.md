### 1. Purpose
This repository covers the essential of Tensorflow for Machine Learning with the objective to increase the knowledge of the best approaches in Machine Learning.
For that the structure of repository follows the subjects of the book _Building Machine Learning Projects with Tensor Flow_ 

### 1. Building Machine Learning Projects with Tensor Flow

This book is for **data analysts, data scientists, and researchers** who want to make the results of
their machine learning activities faster and more efficient. Those who want a crisp guide to
complex numerical computations with TensorFlow will find the book extremely helpful. This
book is also for **developers who want to implement TensorFlow in production** in various
scenarios. Some experience with C++ and Python is expected.
