We will use an \"attention mechanism” that allows the decoder to pay attention to certain parts of the input sequence, rather than using the entire fixed context at every step. At a high level, attention is calculated using the decoder’s current hidden state and the encoder’s outputs. We will also use \"Global attention\", where we consider al of encoder's hidden states, as oppossed to \"Local attention\", which only considers the enconder's hidden state from the current time step, as well as calculate attention weights using the hidden staate of decoder fro the currtent time step only. The output of this attention module is a softmax normalized weights tensor of shape (batch_size, 1, max_length).\n",

This means that at some probability, set by teacher_forcing-ratio, we use the current target word  as the decoder’s next input rather than using the decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we are setting the teacher_forcing_ratio, and not be fooled by fast convergence. The second trick that we implement is **Gradient Clipping**. This is a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient” problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially and either overflow (NaN), or overshoot steep cliffs in the cost function.\n",
